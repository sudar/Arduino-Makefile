###   0.9.3.2 10.ix.2012 Sudar

- Auto detect ARDUINO_DIR, Arduino version (https://github.com/rpavlik/)
- Categorize libs into user and system (https://github.com/rpavlik/)
- Dump size at the end of the build (https://github.com/rpavlik/)
- Lots and lots of improvements (https://github.com/rpavlik/)
- Changed bytes option for the head shell command, so that it works in Mac as well
- Auto detect Serial Baud rate from sketch if possible

### 0.9.2 06.vi.2012

- Allow user to choose source files (LOCAL_*_SRCS flags) (https://github.com/Gaftech)
- Modified "make size" behavior: using --mcu option and targeting .elf file instead of .hex file.(https://github.com/Gaftech)

### 0.9.1 06.vi.2012

- Corrected the ubuntu package names
- Prevent the *file-not-found* error if the depends.mk file is not needed
- Delete the build-cli folder as well while doing make clean
- Added support for compiling .pde files in Arduino 1.0 environment
- Replaced = with += in CPPFLAGS assignment so that we can set CPPFLAGS per sketch if needed
- Changed AVRDUDE_CONF so it can be defined in per-project makefile (https://github.com/WizenedEE)
- Cleaner way to delete the build-cli directory when make clean is invoked
- The package name in Debian and Ubuntu is arduino-mk (https://github.com/maqifrnswa)

### 2012-02-12, version 0.8
- Patches for version 1.0 of the Arduino IDE. Older versions might still work, but Iâ€™ve not tested it.
- A change to the build process: rather than link all the system objects directly into the executable, bundle them in a library first. This should make the final executable smaller.
- If TARGET isnâ€™t explicitly set, default to the current directory name. Thanks to Daniele Vergini for this patch.
- Add support for .c files in system libraries: Dirk-Willem van Gulik and Evan Goldenberg both reported this and provided patches in the same spirit.
- Added a size target as suggested by Alex Satrapa.

### Unreleased, version 0.7
- Added -lm to the linker options, and -F to stty.

### 2011-06-23, version 0.6
- Added ard-parse-boards. Mark Sproul suggested doing something like this ages ago, but Iâ€™ve only recently looked at it in detail.
- Fabien Le Lez reported that one needs to link with -lc to avoid [linker errors](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php/topic,40215.0.html).

### 2011-06-23, version 0.5
- Imported changes from Debian/Ubuntu, which incorporate a patch from Stefan Tomanek so that libraries would be compiled too.

Note: Many other people sent me similar patches, but I didn't get around to using them. In the end, I took the patch from Debian and Ubuntu: there seems merit in not forking the code and using a tested version. So, thanks and apologies to Nick Andrew, Leandro Coletto Biazon, Thibaud Chupin, Craig Hollabaugh, Johannes H. Jensen, Fabien Le Lez, Craig Leres, and Mark Sproul.

### 2010-05-24, version 0.4
Tweaked rules for the reset target on Philip Handsâ€™ advice.

### 2010-05-21, version 0.3
- Tidied up the licensing, making it clear that itâ€™s released under LGPL 2.1.
- [Philip Hands](http://hands.com/~phil/) sent me some code to reset the Arduino by dropping DTR for 100ms, and I added it.
- Tweaked the Makefile to handle version 0018 of the Arduino software which now includes main.cpp. Accordingly we donâ€™t need toâ€”and indeed must notâ€”add main.cxx to the .pde sketch file. The paths seem to have changed a bit too.
