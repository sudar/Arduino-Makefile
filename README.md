# A Makefile for Arduino Sketches

This is a very simple Makefile which knows how to build Arduino sketches.

Until March 2012, this was simply posted on my website where you can
still find [what
documentation](http://mjo.tc/atelier/2009/02/arduino-cli.html
"Documentation") exists.

If you're using Debian or Ubuntu, you can find this in the arduino-core package.
